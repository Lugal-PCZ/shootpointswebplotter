about=Quickly plot shapefiles of total station data collected with ShootPoints-Web.

    This plugin is not necessary for plotting exports of ShootPoints-Web session
    data (which are saved as shapefiles), but is a convenience for quickly plotting,
    grouping, and styling those shapefiles.
    
    Its minimal interface will prompt you to select a directory of exported
    ShootPoints-Web data, from which it will extract the session information,
    plot any shapefiles in the <i>gis_shapefiles</i> subdirectory, group those
    new layers in sub-groups of a <i>ShootPoints Data</i> group, and apply
    layer styles supplied with this plugin.
